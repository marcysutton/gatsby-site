                    </h1>

                    <p>I want everyone who visits MarcySutton.com to feel welcome and find the experience rewarding. This site recently underwent a major redesign and build, and is a work-in-progress.</p>

                    <h2>What am I doing?</h2>

                    <p>To make the website a positive place for everyone, I'm using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a>. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities, and user friendly for everyone.</p>

                    <p>The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA and AAA). Iâ€™ve chosen Level AA as the initial target for this website.</p>

                    <h2>How am I doing?</h2>

                    <p>I've worked hard on the accessibility of MarcySutton.com to achieve my goal of Level AA accessibility. I monitor it regularly to maintain access, but if you do find any problems, please <Link to="/contact">get in touch</Link>.</p>
