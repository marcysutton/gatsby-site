                            <p><em>(See <a href="#bio-short-version">bonus short version, below</a>)</em></p>
                            <p>I'm a Lead Software Engineer on the Developer Relations team at <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">Gatsby</a>, a remote startup creating fast, accessible websites and webapps while building a strong community (I was their Head of Learning for a year, before requesting a role change). Previously, I was a Developer Advocate on the <a href="https://www.deque.com/products/axe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">axe-core</a> team developing web accessibility testing tools. I've also worked as an accessibility engineer at <a href="https://adobe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">Adobe</a>, and as a web developer at <a href="https://substantial.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">Substantial</a>, <a href="https://wearepop.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">POP</a> and <a href="https://deicreative.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">DEI Creative</a>.</p>
                            <p>I'm passionate about improving the web for people with disabilities and I often speak at conferences about it. My blog, <a href="http://a11ywins.tumblr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">Accessibility Wins</a>, highlights accessible user interfaces and tools. In 2016, O'Reilly presented me with a Web Platform Award for my work in accessibility. I'm a co-leader of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/a11ysea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">Accessibility Seattle Meetup</a>, and I founded a social coding group for women in my city of Bellingham called <a href="https://www.meetup.com/NW-Tech-Women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">NW Tech Women</a>.</p>

                            <p>My education includes a Bachelor of Arts in Visual Journalism from Brooks Institute of Photography and an Associate of Applied Arts in Web Design &#038; Multimedia from the Art Institute of Seattle. I became very interested in web development during college, creating HTML websites for photo documentary classes and later, <a href="https://marcy.codes/v2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">interactive Flash websites</a>. I naturally went back to HTML &amp; CSS, with ECMAScript experience that helped me fall in love with JavaScript. When I learned about Web Accessibility, I liked that it reflected my values and added meaning to my work. I love solving problems with design and code when they have potential to help as many people as possible.</p>

                            <p>I'm inspired by nature, street art, typography, and music, and I try to appreciate life's ups and downs. I like cooking and baking pies, and doing night photography. I'm also pretty hooked on <a href="https://instagram.com/marcysutton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">riding bikes and playing outside</a>.</p>
