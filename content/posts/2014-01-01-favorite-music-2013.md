## FAVORITE MIXES

I also had a few longer mixes on repeat:

### [PillowTalk - Resident Advisor Valentines Podcast (opens in a new window)](https://soundcloud.com/pillow-talk-1/pillowtalk-ra-valentines "Link opens in a new window")

I learned of PillowTalk after their show at the Decibel Festival. I'm bummed to have missed it, but on the bright side I'm overjoyed to have learned about them--and I loved this podcast!

### [Nu:Logic - FABRICLIVE Promo Mix (opens in a new window)](https://soundcloud.com/fabric/nu-logic-fabriclive-promo-mix "Link opens in a new window")

As a longtime fan of Nu:Tone, Logistics and Hospital Records, the new release from Nu:Logic was bound to be a slam dunk. This mix includes some dance-floor bangers that have had me dancing around town for months.

### [DEVolution - FABRICLIVE Promo Mix (opens in a new window)](https://soundcloud.com/wearedevolution/devolution-fabric-mix-1 "Link opens in a new window")

Favorite new artist of 2013? DEVolution provides the perfect blend of dancy bass, kick drum and attitude that puts me in frolicky spirits. Everything I hear from Black Butter Records sounds fantastic--I'm excited to hear more.

### [Kidnap Kid - Summer Mix (opens in a new window)](https://soundcloud.com/kidnap_kid/summer-mix "Link opens in a new window")

I also heard about Kidnap Kid through [Black Butter Records' Soundcloud page (opens in a new window)](https://soundcloud.com/black-butter-records "Link opens in a new window"). A similar dancy vibe to DEVolution, everything from Kidnap Kid puts my feet on an instant dance floor.

### [Tensnake - ON REPEAT Volume 2 (opens in a new window)](https://soundcloud.com/tensnake/on-repeat-volume-2 "Link opens in a new window")

We saw Tensnake play at Q Nightclub in Seattle in 2013 and I've loved finding his mixes ever since. This one is a delight!

### [The 2 Bears - Is this Cajmere? (opens in a new window)](https://soundcloud.com/the2bears/the-2-bears-is-this-cajmere "Link opens in a new window")

Cajmere/Green Velvet was a highlight at Decibel Festival...this tribute mix by The 2 Bears is a little campy with the vocal samples & horns, I love it!
