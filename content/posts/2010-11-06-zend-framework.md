**...is awesome.**

I love that I've gotten to use Zend Framework on a few projects recently. While I do work with other platforms at [POP](http://pop.us), PHP frameworks are my favorite; configuration and syntax are very intuitive as a Javascript and Flash developer. I'm excited to learn other frameworks, too -- for now I'm simply loving the hands-on experience with Object-Oriented PHP and the MVC pattern.

Some of the challenges & successes of my recent Zend projects:

- Two modules: default and mobile
- Twitter feed caching for page performance & API request limits
- Custom view helpers for outputting content
- Use of the BundleScript Helper
- Custom routes for a specific URL structure
- Use of built-in head script and style helpers for clean layout templates

I'm excited to learn more about Zend and other frameworks; the best part of being a web developer is expanding my skill-set. I love challenges, so having them built-in to my job make it super satisfying!
