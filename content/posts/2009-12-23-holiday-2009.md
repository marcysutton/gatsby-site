For the second year in a row, I have lovingly compiled a mix of my favorite tunes from the past twelve months. This time around, I discovered a way to post the mix online using a PHP app called OPENTAPE. The creative process usually starts around August when I decide what will be my first track, and from there I keep the topic in mind as I discover new artists and find my new favorite albums. My musical tastes vary from electronic music to hip hop, to soul, blues and jazz, and random styles in between. The mix has a party vibe to it, and definitely does not contain Christmas music. Feel free to leave comments or questions!
