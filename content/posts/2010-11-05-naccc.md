In October 2010, I traveled to Atlanta for the [North American Cycle Courier Championships](http://dirtysouthmessengers.com "NACCCs") and raced with some peeps in Grant Park. No, I'm not a messenger. But I won a trip courtesy of Dead Baby Bikes here in Seattle after taking 1st place for the women in their "Longboard" race (alley-cat) in August.... and why say no to a free trip?

I partook in the non-courier race and finished last of the people who actually completed it (a few dropped out) -- but since I was the only woman, I won by default. Kind of embarrassing, but a win's a win!
