Now available: the self-paced workshop series, [TestingAccessibility.com](https://testingaccessibility.com)! I created a series of learning resources about web accessibility to increase adoption and make our digital world more inclusive.

With Testing Accessibility, I'll provide you with workshops, articles, and more to improve your technical _and_ people skills around accessibility. I've put 13+ years of experience as a web developer and educator into this project, including the few years at the beginning when I didn't know _anything_ about accessibility. We all have to start somewhere!

This project was partly inspired by Kent C. Dodds' [testingjavascript.com](https://testingjavascript.com), which included an interview with me from a few years ago. I also recorded an [accessibility course](https://egghead.io/courses/start-building-accessible-web-applications-today) for [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io), my Testing Accessibility project partners, and I've wanted to do more ever since.

But most importantly, I see a continual need for technical, yet human education about accessibility. Industry giants like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Pinterest have sought out my training for accessibility, as they needed help just like everyone else.

My goal is to teach you how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for good. Youâ€™ll make the digital world a better place, particularly for people with disabilities who might not be able to use your sites and apps otherwise.
