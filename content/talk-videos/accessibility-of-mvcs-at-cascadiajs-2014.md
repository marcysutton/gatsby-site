In August 2014, after attending the two previous years, I finally spoke at CascadiaJS in Portland, Oregon about the Accessibility of JavaScript MVC frameworks, titled "ARIA Was Made For This." It was the first major time I'd given the talk, and it evolved quite a bit for JSConf EU a few months later. One thing I noticed after this talk was even though I made a few mistakes, I was less hard on myself about them. It felt like a growth moment. I really enjoyed contributing a topic at a conference that seemed to value the same things I did: diversity, creativity, accessibility and generally being a good person (even if we're all hipsters).
