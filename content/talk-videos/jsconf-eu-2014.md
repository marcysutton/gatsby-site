In September 2014, I traveled to Berlin, Germany to speak about the accessibility of JavaScript MV* frameworks like Angular, Ember, and Backbone. Because of the city's reputation for incredible dance music and arts, I approached the talk from a playful position, wearing gold pants and encouraging dance moves. It was a great time! I wrote about the whole experience on the <a href="http://substantial.com/blog/2014/10/07/jsconf-eu-berlin/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank">Substantial blog</a>.
