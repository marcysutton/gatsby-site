In November 2015, I traveled to Europe to present this talk on mobile web accessibility. In Berlin, I presented a version at <a href="https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2015/speakers/marcy-sutton">Beyond Tellerrand</a>. In Brighton, UK, I delivered this updated version. The goal was to document the current state of mobile web accessibility tooling, while inspiring people to take up the causeâ€“rather than conceding defeat to native accessibility, which has traditionally been better for people with disabilities. By this time next year, I hope to see better tools for testing accessibility on the mobile web, improving the state of things as a result.
