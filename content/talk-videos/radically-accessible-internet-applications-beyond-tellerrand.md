In June 2018, I traveled to Berlin once again for JSConf EU. I was delighted when they accepted my proposal to speak on the main stage, where I live debugged and coded for accessibility with React. Any time I get to spread the word about accessibility in front of a mainstream developer conference makes me quite happy. This talk was round 3 or 4 of preparation for Smashing Conf Toronto, who asked specifically for a live coding talk. So I was stoked to get a chance to practice it before the final version!
