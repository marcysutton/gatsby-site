In July 2016 I flew to Oakland to speak at the first-ever <a href="http://npm.camp">npm camp</a>, a single-day conference run by the team behind our favorite web package manager, npm, inc. I was really happy to contribute a talk on automated accessibility testing with aXe, the talk I was basically hired to do. It only took me 8 months (I've done other talks since then, but this is *the* one.) In this talk, I cover some background on accessibility and how to use the aXe API to check for it in unit and integration tests. I'm pretty happy with the way it turned out!
