This year I had the pleasure of giving one of a few keynote talks at O'Reilly's Fluent Conference in San Jose, California. Given such a huge opportunity to highlight accessibility at a mainstream conference, I urged developers to open their minds to alternative ways of navigating the web. Ditch the mouse, support other inputs, and work accessibility into your modern web applications. It doesn't have to be boring!
