In April 2017 I traveled to San Francisco to speak at Smashing Conf, delivering a brand-new talk on an issue that comes up frequently in front-end development: should I use a link or a button element in my user interface? It isn't always an easy decision to make, as even though the two controls have similarities, they are often at odds with each other. In this wrestling-style showdown, I cover best practices and tips for making better decisions when it comes to user interface controls.

Editor's note: as a bonus effort I ended up emceeing the conference on the second day. Despite feeling a tad overwhelmed at the start, I was happy with the performance by the end.
