In December 2014, I got to travel up to Whistler, Canada to speak at the first Smashing Conf Canada. Despite the fact it rained instead of snowed, I had a great time hanging in the village and attending the conference. I spoke about accessibility in the context of accessible UIs and Web Components, as well as people's assumptions about it. Everyone thinks they're exempt from accessibility. I was happy I got to say everything I wanted to say. The two following talks that day by Jenn Lukas and Zach Leatherman built on top of my chosen subject matter. It was so fantastic to be a part of it!
