In September, I gave a talk at the inaugural Responsive Field Day in Portland, Oregon. It was a huge honor to speak alongside web veterans like Jeremy Keith (whose Responsive Day Out was the inspiration for this conference), Ethan Marcotte, Jen Simmons, Brad Frost, and so many other talented speakers.

My talk on mobile web accessibility was one I've been refining for the past few months, having given it twice before at Open Web Camp and SeattleJS. I'm doing an updated version of it at Beyond Tellerrand and ffconf, complete with a new title. I'm happy with the way this one turned out, even if I had incomplete information about Safari's devtools. Things are already improving in the mobile web accessibility space!
