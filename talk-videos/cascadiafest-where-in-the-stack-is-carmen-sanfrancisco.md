I had the pleasure of speaking at Cascadia Fest 2016 on automated accessibility testing. This was the first time I presented a talk in the theme of my favorite childhood computer game, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? In it, I presented gotchas I'd stumbled on working with Node.js APIs, client-side JavaScript and browser extensions.
