In August 2016, I drove down to Utah to do my first-ever keynote talk at React Rally. I spoke about gotchas in accessibility testing using React.js. In an alternate universe it may have been a boring talkâ€“but I decided to invoke a bit of childhood nostalgia in the theme of my favorite geography computer game, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? The audience really seemed to enjoy it, which made all the production work worth it.
