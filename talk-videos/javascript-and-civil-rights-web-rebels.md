In June 2017, I traveled to Oslo, Norway to give a new talk on something very important to me: JavaScript and Civil Rights. I discuss how our work as web technologists impacts our users' rights, from accessibility to privacy to safety. We should take care to both protect and enable our users by ensuring we don't leak their private details or mistakenly introduce barriers to access.

Thanks to Web Rebels for having me!
