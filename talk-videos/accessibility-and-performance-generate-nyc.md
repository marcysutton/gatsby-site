In April 2016, I gave a talk on accessibility and performance for netmag's Generate conference in New York City. I gave a shorter version of this talk at <a href="https://marcysutton.com/talk/fronteers-accessibility-and-performance/">Fronteers</a>, practiced it at SeattleJS, and later wrote <a href="https://marcysutton.com/accessibility-and-performance/">a blog post about my research</a>. <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/advice/accessibility-and-performance-in-web-design">Read their write-up</a>. <a href="https://marcysutton.github.io/a11y-perf/#/">See my talk slides</a>.
