I recently spoke at ngEurope in Paris on Accessibility of AngularJS and my work on Material Design. I used some of the information from my Accessibility of MVC frameworks talk at JSConf EU but added more Angular-specific details including ngAria, the new module for accessibility. I was happy to get a direct rebuttal to the VirginAmerica.com talk the day before, which although it has been called "slick", still as of this writing has terrible accessibility.

One really cool thing about my trip to Paris for ngEurope: I had my single-speed cyclocross bike with me and I got to ride all over the city! It was one of the coolest things I've ever gotten to do in my life and I hope to repeat it again in the future.
