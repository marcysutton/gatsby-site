In early May 2019, I traveled to London, UK to speak at a new community conference called [React.js Girls](https://reactjsgirls.com/). As soon as I heard about the event [I knew I wanted to be there](https://twitter.com/marcysutton/status/1076196529877073920), as I work with React every day on the Gatsby team and I LOVE being in spaces created for women (and their allies). At the conference, I did a 20-minute version of my live accessibility debugging adventure, and had a great time.

It was pretty much impossible to cover everything I wanted the audience to know in that short amount of time, but I hoped to open everyone's minds to accessibility testing so they would feel empowered to learn more. I got some of the most awesome feedback from that talk than I have in years, with multiple people saying they were going to adopt new techniques at their jobs "on Monday". Sounds like it was a success to me! I also wore an avocado shirt I found in London, in honor of [Sara Vieira](https://twitter.com/NikkitaFTW), coiner of the term "developer avocado" (developer advocate). ;)
