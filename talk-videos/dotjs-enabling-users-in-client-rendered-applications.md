In December 2017, I traveled with my Mom to Paris to give a talk at dotJS. I only had 18 minutes, which was a challenging lengthâ€“it required boiling it down the essentials to make the most impact. I decided to show 1400+ European JavaScript developers how to code for accessibility. It was nerve-wracking but fun, and I'm super proud to have done it. Looking forward to my talks at Beyond Tellerrand and ScriptConf in January, when I can expand more fully on accessibility debugging and fit in way more details.
