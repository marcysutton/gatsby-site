My talk from O'Reilly's Fluent conference in April in San Francisco: Accessibility in AngularJS and Beyond. I highlighted common accessibility challenges in single-page apps and discussed how Angular has begun supporting web developers with accessibility features baked right into the framework, proving that it's never too late to start.
