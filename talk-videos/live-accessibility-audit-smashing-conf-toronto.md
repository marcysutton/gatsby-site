In June 2018 I traveled to Toronto, Canada for the latest edition of Smashing Conf. This year they challenged us to present without slides, a special treat for the audience to observe <em>how</em> we do our work. I did some live accessibility debugging and coding in React, taking a modern-JavaScript approach to web accessibility. Because it was for Smashing, whose audiences range from highly technical to beautifully creative, I worked in a new section on handling animations safely using prefers-reduced-motion. I was happy with the result, and for the long time off from speaking that followed!
