On April 1 in Amsterdam, I presented a <a href="https://vimeo.com/163096111">20-minute talk</a> at the first-ever <a href="https://fronteers.nl/congres/2016-spring">Fronteers Spring Thing</a> on Accessibility and Performance. I recently <a href="https://marcysutton.com/accessibility-and-performance/">wrote a longer post</a> on the subject after giving the talk again in a longer format at Seattle JS and Generate.
