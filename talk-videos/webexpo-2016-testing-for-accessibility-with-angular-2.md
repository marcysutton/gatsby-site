I traveled to Prague, Czech Republic in September 2016 to present on Accessibility Testing with Angular. I enjoyed speaking on this subject for 40 minutes and exploring the beautiful city. It was a great event!

The talk was created with SlidesLive, an interactive experience with slides and video next to each other. It can be viewed here: <a href="http://slideslive.com/38898235">http://slideslive.com/38898235</a>
