When I redesigned this website in November 2014, I had a design aesthetic in mind for the main navigation: a "hamburger" menu icon in the top right corner exposing a list of links on the right side on click or tap, effectively sliding the page out of the way. I looked up a few demos for inspiration, and found these:

- [iOS Style Sliding Menu on Codepen](http://codepen.io/jasonhowmans/pen/dykhL "Link opens in a new window")
- [Sitepoint Pure CSS Off-Screen Navigation Menu](http://www.sitepoint.com/pure-css-off-screen-navigation-menu/ "Link opens in a new window")

I could see it wouldn't be too difficult to code a basic slide menu using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (I wasn't a fan of the CSS-only solution). The trick was making it accessible using keyboards and screen readers. I thought I had a workable solution, and then I discovered a big problem: pages weren't scrollable in mobile Voiceover with [3-finger swipe](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/TestingAccessibilityOfiOSApps/TestAccessibilityonYourDevicewithVoiceOver/TestAccessibilityonYourDevicewithVoiceOver.html "Link opens in a new window")! It made reading articles impossible, since they always read "page 1 of 1", even though there were clearly more pages. So I set out to fix it. Read on for the solution and check out my Codepen demo below to see the finished result!

## Logical source order

The slide effect required a `nav` outside of the main `#content` wrapper so each element could be positioned independently and animated. My first challenge was creating a logical page structure while keeping my design aesthetic...I wondered, _should my nav come first in the document or last?_ I settled on first, since the links were visually at the top. My desired tab order was the site logo link, then the menu button, the menu links (when open) and the rest of the main content. To accomplish this, I added `tabindex="1"` to the site logo link and `tabindex="2"` to the hamburger button so they always came first in the tab order. Then the rest of the content followed. This is breaking the general rule that you should avoid positive integer tabindex values, but I did it for a specific keyboard order. [Read more about tabindex](http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2014/08/using-the-tabindex-attribute/ "Link opens in a new window").

## Managing visibility & focus

While the nav was visually hidden, I set `aria-hidden="true"` on it and `tabindex="-1"` on the child links. I wrote some JavaScript to update those attributes, hiding and unhiding them as the menu was toggled. To work with the document source order required by the sliding pattern, I also managed focus when the menu was toggled: hit SPACE on the menu button when closed and see focus sent into the first menu link. Hit ESC anywhere in the menu to see focus sent back to the menu button. (An alternative to managing tabindex and aria-hidden would be to use `display:none` after animating.)

For screen readers, I established an ARIA relationship between the nav and button using `<button aria-controls="navId" aria-haspopup="true">` and `<nav id="navId">`. I also toggled the text "Menu collapsed" and "Menu expanded" on the button using `aria-label` and JavaScript since it was more reliable than `aria-expanded`. I'm hard-coding the text in JavaScript, but I might do it differently if I had to support internationalization.

## The Mobile Voiceover Bug

Many of the demos I found used `position:fixed;` or `absolute` on the main content area with CSS overflow to scroll the content and some basic animations to slide in the menu. When I checked my first iteration in mobile VoiceOver, the screen reader on iOS devices, I found a major bug where pages wouldn't scroll. D'oh!

When browsing mobile optimized webpages, Voiceover normally calculates and announces the number of screens on a given page ("page 1 of 3", "page 2 of 5", etc.). Pages on my site that clearly spanned more than one screen length were always announced as "page 1 of 1" and they wouldn't scroll. It worked fine in Chrome for Android thoughâ€“I had stumbled upon a bug in Voiceover related to fixed/absolute positioning in CSS.

## The fix

The trick to making pages scrollable in mobile Voiceover is to keep main content areas in the normal document flow using `position:relative`, not `absolute`. (I think `overflow:hidden` and `max-height:100%` on the body element causes problems too, but I need to do more research.) The `nav` _can_ use fixed positioning and slide in next to the rest of the content. One limitation is that a menu that also overflows the page height probably won't scroll in Voiceover, as it will suffer from the original positioning bug.

The fix was simple enough, but I suspect this issue is present all over the Web. I've seen a ton of websites and web-apps using fixed or absolute CSS positioning on the main content area, and barely anyone tests in mobile screen readers. Let's change that! Here are some [testing tips from Henny Swan](http://www.iheni.com/talk-is-cheap-screen-reader-testing-on-mobile/ "Link opens in a new window"). They're from 2011, but still relevant. TalkBack on Android has gotten a lot better, too.

This is one instance where mobile web accessibility can be easily wrong, and even I had trouble with it at first. It would be awesome to get a bug report filed with Apple. For now, to make it easier to create an accessible slide menu, I've abstracted mine into a demo on Codepen. I encourage you to test it in Voiceover to see for yourself!

### [Menu Demo](http://codepen.io/marcysutton/pen/JoQqVw "Link opens in a new window")

This example shows how to create an accessible slide menu independent from my site. It uses CSS to animate `translateX` to perform better on mobile devices, thanks to hardware acceleration.

<div data-height="268" data-theme-id="11082" data-slug-hash="JoQqVw" data-default-tab="html" data-user="marcysutton" class="codepen"><pre><code>&lt;nav id="global-nav" aria-label="Main navigation"&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Posts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Talks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;div id="container"&gt;
  &lt;header role="banner"&gt;
    &lt;div class="inner-header"&gt;
      &lt;div class="header-flex"&gt;
        &lt;h1 class="site-title"&gt;
      &lt;!-- tabindex="1" so this link is always first in the tab order --&gt;
           &lt;a href="#" tabindex="1"&gt;
              Accessible Slide Menu
            &lt;/a&gt;
         &lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;button aria-controls="global-nav" tabindex="2"&gt; id="menu-button"&gt;
          &lt;span class="menu-icon" aria-hidden="true"&gt;
            &lt;svg version='1.1' x='0px' y='0px' width='30px' height='30px' viewBox='0 0 30 30' enable-background='new 0 0 30 30'&gt;&lt;rect width='30' height='5'/&gt;&lt;rect y='24' width='30' height='5' /&gt;&lt;rect y='12' width='30' height='5'/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="menu-text"&gt;Menu&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
