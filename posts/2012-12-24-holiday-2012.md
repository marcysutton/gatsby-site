I love music. I cherish finding new favorite artists & albums; the Internet is great for that. For each of the past five years I have compiled a playlist of favorite tunes...an audio diary I can share and revisit for years to come. I've also started listing 10 favorite albums that I still have on repeat and don't want to forgetâ€”those can be found at the bottom of this post.

If you're on the hunt for mixsets like I always am, you've come to the right place. Long mixes are the best for workouts, parties, working, driving or any time, really! (I never thought I'd have a reason to say this, but [check out my pinboard](http://pinterest.com/marcysuttonpop/music-mixes/ "Link opens in a new window").)
