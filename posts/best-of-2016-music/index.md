I've compiled my favorite music again all year (for the 8th time!), but it's been a while since I wrote about it on this website. In recognition of how much energy and happiness music brings to my life, I've once again cataloged my favorite tunes and albums of 2016. Hip hop, house, reggae, drum & bass...it varies from year to year, but the main thing I'd like you to take away is with me, a dance break could come at ANY TIME!

## Top Mixes of 2016

I stream a lot of dj mixes–they help me keep focus and bring plenty of music discoveries. Here are some of my favorites from this year:

- ### Solid Steel Radio Show 24/6/2016 Hour 1 - Moneyshot + Cheeba (Odelay Tribute Mix)
    
    I must have listened to this mix 20 times in a row. It really took me back to carpooling in school and subjecting my Mom to listening to Beck's Odelay album over and over.

- ### Digitalism: Music To... Get Lost In
    
    This is my favorite workout mix from the year–played many times in my basement workout space, prompting dance breaks a-plenty!

Get Lost In"></iframe>
    

- ### Baby Prince - I Want More Of You \[Live @ Contact - Tokyo\]
    
    Even Jonathan Snook said he liked this one–incredibly house heavy, it had me dancing around the house this summer after we moved into our new house.

- ### POOLS - Mix for Brighter Days at The Standard LA Rooftop
    
    This mix reminds me of doing yard work on sunnier days.

- ### Solid Steel Radio Show 18/11/2016 Hour 1 - Mighty Atom - Endtroducing Tribute Mix
    
    Last, but not least: a tribute mix for DJ Shadow's Endtroducing album, a highly influential one for preteen Marcy Sutton.
    
    <iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/293385363&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true" title="Endtroducing Tribute Mix"></iframe>
