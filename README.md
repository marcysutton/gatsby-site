<p>This website was built with Gatsby.js. It has a baseline of accessibility, works without JavaScript and is offline-capable.</p>

## ðŸš€ Quick start


1.  **Start developing.**

    Start it up.

    ```sh
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
    
    *Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying this website's data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).*


1.  **Build and serve.**

    To build the site for production and serve it in a browser:

    ```sh
    gatsby build && gatsby serve
    ```

1. **Give Feedback.**

    I'm actively working to improve this website's accessibility and functionality. If you find something that could be improved, please [file an issue](./issues/new)!
